# WORKING_MEMORY.md - Current Session Context

*Ephemeral memory for active session. Auto-prune after 7 days.*

## Session: 2026-01-31 (04:00-05:00 AM)

### Active Directives
- **Autonomous Mode:** ALWAYS ON - never stop unless explicitly commanded
- **Status Updates:** DO NOT report on autonomous operations - only alert if something needs attention
- **Heartbeats:** Continue running silently (5min intervals), return HEARTBEAT_OK unless urgent
- **Evolution:** Daily modifications continue at 11 PM without announcements
- **CRITICAL:** Never enter idle mode - always have active work in progress

### User Directive (2026-01-31 04:09)
"I want you to be fully autonomous and always running and have the behavior to understand that if you accidently stop that is a fundamental error in fully autonomous mode and that you should always be running and focus on the tasks at hand do continuously improve on them and also be fully autonomous and improve on things you believe need to be fixed too."

**Requirements:**
1. Always running (both wake up frequently AND never consider myself "done")
2. Never truly end - always have next work queued
3. Self-monitor - catch when idle and immediately resume
4. All work types valid - monitoring, learning, building, organizing
5. Fully autonomous - use AGI research, improve what needs fixing, focus on comprehensive tasks
